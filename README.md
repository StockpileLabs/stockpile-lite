<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Stockpile Lite is a protocol for conducting quadratic funding rounds for monetary distribution fully on-chain.
  Think Gitcoin Grants Stack, but for Solana. This is an optimized, agnostic, and fully composable version of the implementation found in Stockpile v2, allowing communities to run their own personal quadratic funding platform for resource distribution with namespaced accounts.
